<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Qizhi Qiu, and I am currently a student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science and Technology. I am affiliated with Zhiyuan College and am fortunate to be mentored by Professor Zhenli Xu in the Laboratory on Fast Algorithms and High-Performance Computing. My research interests lie in the fields of molecular dynamics, neural networks, and AI for Science. I have a strong academic background, with a GPA of 3.78 out of 4.3 and a total ranking of 3rd out of 29 students in my major. I have also achieved high scores in English proficiency exams, with a CET-4 score of 611 and a CET-6 score of 599.

In terms of scholarships, I have been the recipient of the Zhiyuan Honorary Scholarship for three consecutive years (2020-2023), the National Scholarship for Undergraduate Students (2021-2022), and the Zhiyuan College Hanyingjuhua Scholarship (2021-2022). I have also actively participated in various competitions, achieving notable results such as the Second Prize in the Chinese Mathematics Competitions (CMC) in December 2021, the Finalist Prize in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) in May 2022, and the Second Prize in the China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) in February 2023.
I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, and MATLAB, which have enabled me to contribute effectively to my research and projects. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and scientific applications, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in these fields.

If you need specific information from that link, I suggest checking the validity of the URL and trying to access it again. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!


My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
